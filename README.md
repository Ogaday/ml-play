Machine Learning Play
=====================

My repo for playing with machine learning concepts, ideas and practice.

Initial exploration and explanation will often be done in Jupyter Notebooks, in the notebook directory. Code relating to a specific areas of ML will be encapsulated in different modules, such as the ann module which contains code relating to artificial neural networks.

This repo was developed on Ubuntu and the conda evironment I am using can be emulated by following the instructions in requirements\_ubuntu.txt
