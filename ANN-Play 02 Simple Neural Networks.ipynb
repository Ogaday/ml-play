    "I will try a graphical representation of the neural network. A graph is often defined by a triple: $(V, E, \\varepsilon)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of edges and $\\varepsilon$ is the endpoint map $\\varepsilon:E\\to P_1\\{V\\}\\cup P_2\\{V\\}$. (A mapping of edges to the union of the power set of one and the power set of two of the set of vertices).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the graph is weighted, so we introduce a metric map $\\mu$ such that $\\mu: E \\to \\mathbb R$, where $\\mathbb R$ is the set of real values and the mapping denotes of the weight on each edge. Furthermore, this graph should be loop free, so in fact we can simplify $\\varepsilon$ to $\\varepsilon:E\\to P_2\\{V\\}$ and as this graph is directed, order of the elements of $p_i \\in P_2\\{V\\}$ matters.\n",

    "Let's try to define the architecture necessary to describe the exercise in Carlos Gershenson's [document](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Neural-Net-%5BCarlos-Gershenson%5D.pdf)."
