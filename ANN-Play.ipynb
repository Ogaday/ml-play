    "# Artificial Neural Network Play\n",
    "\n",
    "An exploration of artificial neural networks. I already have an understanding on artificial neural networks from my final year at university, but I think that understanding is quite theoretical and shallow. I would like to play with neural networks so that I become familiar with their intricacies and gotchas. The purpose then of this document is to start from the very bottom and work my way up, developing the components of and then a whole artificial neural network from scratch before moving onto using established libraries (PyBrain, scikit-learn, etc.) and employing optimisations, such as using Theano.\n",

    "There are a couple of tutorials, articles and such which I might be following closely, along with other more rigorous sources. They are:\n",

    "The anatomy of a neural network seems clear: it consists of neurons ands connections, corresponding to nodes and directed, weighted edges in the terminology of graphs. I believe that artifificial neural networks will always be able to be represented as directed, weighted, non cyclic-graphs. The network will consist of one input layer (one node for each input), one output layer (one node for each output) and any number of \"hidden\" layers, layers which do not recieve direct inputs or produce direct outputs. Each neuron will have inputs and one output. An \"activation function\" will produce a result, analogous to a real neuron firing, based upon the inputs multiplied by the weights. The weights characterise the network, and the power of neural networks comes in learning the weights, so that the final outputs match specific targets. And that, in a nutshell, is the essense of a neural network (without touching on backpropogation at all)!\n",

    "The initial exploration will be based on Carlos Gershenson's pdf on the topic of artificial neural networks. It's an ab initio introduction, and will introduce ANNs in simple terms that I can then emulate in code."
